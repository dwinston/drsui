DrsUI is intended to be a browser UI for a [data repository service (DRS)](https://ga4gh.github.io/data-repository-service-schemas/preview/release/drs-1.0.0/docs/).

In particular, it aims to facilitate creation of DrsObject resources as desired by the [National Microbiome Data Collaborative](https://microbiomedata.org/) (NMDC) [Runtime API](https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-runtime/) ([interactive OpenAPI docs](https://api.dev.microbiomedata.org/docs#/objects)), as the upsteam DRS API specification only describes read-only endpoints.
